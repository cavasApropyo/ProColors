## First-class Language Support
__Pro Colors__ supports a big range of languages very good. It fully implements the [TextMate's tmTheme colors](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/color_schemes_tmtheme.html) so all of the languages are supported, but Pro Colors provides first-class support for these languages, First-class support means that each token of the language grammar has it's own unique Pro Colors custom coloring, making sure all tokens are colored and the overall experience is harmonized and legible.
