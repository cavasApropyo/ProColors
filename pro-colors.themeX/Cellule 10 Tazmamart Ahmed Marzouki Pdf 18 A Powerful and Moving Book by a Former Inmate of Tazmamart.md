Tazmamart Cellule 10 is a book by Ahmed Marzouki, a former Moroccan army officer who was imprisoned for 18 years in a secret prison called Tazmamart. The book is a harrowing account of his ordeal, from his arrest in 1973 for his alleged involvement in two failed coup attempts against King Hassan II, to his release in 1991 after an international campaign for his freedom.
 
Marzouki describes the inhuman conditions he and his fellow inmates endured in Tazmamart, where they were kept in tiny cells with no light, ventilation, or sanitation. They suffered from hunger, thirst, disease, torture, and isolation. Many of them died or went insane. Marzouki himself survived by clinging to his faith, his dignity, and his hope for justice.
