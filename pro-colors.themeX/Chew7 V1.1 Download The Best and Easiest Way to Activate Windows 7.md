Neal 'n' Nikki is a movie that explores the themes of love, commitment, and cultural differences. The film shows how Neal and Nikki, who have contrasting personalities and backgrounds, gradually develop feelings for each other despite their initial attraction to other people. The film also portrays the challenges and misunderstandings that arise when two people from different cultures try to communicate and relate to each other. The film has a humorous tone and does not take itself too seriously. The film is meant to be a fun and enjoyable watch for the viewers who like romantic comedies.

One of the highlights of the movie is the performance of the lead actors, Uday Chopra and Tanishaa Mukerji. They both deliver convincing and charming portrayals of their characters, and share a great on-screen rapport. Uday Chopra, who is also the producer of the film, shows his versatility and comic timing as Neal, a confused and conflicted young man who is torn between his traditional values and his modern desires. Tanishaa Mukerji, who made her debut with this film, impresses with her confidence and charisma as Nikki, a bold and independent woman who is not afraid to speak her mind and follow her heart.
 
The movie also has some memorable dialogues and scenes that add to the humor and romance of the story. For example, when Neal asks Nikki what she wants from him, she replies, "I want you to want me". When Neal tries to impress a girl by pretending to be a doctor, Nikki spoils his plan by revealing that he is actually a software engineer. When Neal and Nikki get stuck in a snowstorm and have to share a cabin with a couple of strangers, they pretend to be married and end up kissing each other. The movie also has some emotional moments, such as when Neal realizes that he loves Nikki and decides to call off his wedding, or when Nikki confesses her feelings to Neal and asks him to stay with her.
