Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 3 is the third and final installment of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force series for the PlayStation Portable. It is based on the fourth season of the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime and features over 3500 cards, including anime-exclusive cards. The game also has a multiplayer mode where you can team up with a partner and duel against other players online or locally.
 
If you are a fan of the original Japanese voice acting of the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime, you might be disappointed to know that the European version of the game only has English voice acting. However, there is a way to enjoy the game with Japanese voice acting by using a fan-made patch called Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 3 Iso Undub. This patch replaces the English voice files with the Japanese ones, giving you a more authentic experience of the game.
