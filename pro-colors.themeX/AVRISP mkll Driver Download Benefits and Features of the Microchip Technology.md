# How to Install AVRISP mkII Driver on Windows 10
 
If you want to use AVRISP mkII programmer with Arduino IDE or AVRDUDE, you may need to install a compatible driver on your Windows 10 PC. The default driver that comes with Atmel Studio may not work well with these tools. In this article, we will show you how to install the libusb-win32 driver for AVRISP mkII using a software called Zadig[^2^].
 
## Steps to Install AVRISP mkII Driver
 
1. Download Zadig from [https://zadig.akeo.ie/](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) and run it.
2. Connect your AVRISP mkII programmer to your PC via USB cable.
3. From the dropdown menu, select "AVRISP mkII". If it doesn't show up on the menu, then select Options > List all devices and check again.
4. Click the up or down arrows next to the Driver selection box on the right side until you see "libusbK".
5. Click the Replace Driver button. After the driver installation process finishes, you can close Zadig.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If you have Atmel Studio installed, you may need to disable the driver signature enforcement on Windows 10 before installing the libusb-win32 driver. You can do this by holding Shift and selecting Restart from the Start menu, then choosing Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > See more recovery options > Startup Settings > Disable Driver Signature Enforcement[^1^].
- If you want to use Atmel Studio again, you may need to reinstall the original driver for AVRISP mkII using Atmel Flip software. You can download it from [https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/flip](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/flip) and follow the instructions in the user manual[^1^].
- If you encounter any problems with Zadig or libusb-win32 driver, you can check their websites for more information or contact their support team.

## Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you how to install the libusb-win32 driver for AVRISP mkII on Windows 10 using Zadig software. This driver allows you to use AVRISP mkII programmer with Arduino IDE or AVRDUDE without any issues. We hope this article was helpful and informative for you.

## How to Use AVRISP mkII with Arduino IDE
 
After installing the libusb-win32 driver for AVRISP mkII, you can use it with Arduino IDE to program your Arduino boards. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open Arduino IDE and select the board and port that you want to program.
2. Go to Tools > Programmer and select "AVRISP mkII".
3. Write or open the sketch that you want to upload to your board.
4. Click the Upload button or press Ctrl+U. The Arduino IDE will use AVRISP mkII to upload the sketch to your board.

You can also use AVRISP mkII to burn the bootloader to your board if needed. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Open Arduino IDE and select the board and port that you want to program.
2. Go to Tools > Programmer and select "AVRISP mkII".
3. Go to Tools > Burn Bootloader. The Arduino IDE will use AVRISP mkII to burn the bootloader to your board.

## How to Use AVRISP mkII with AVRDUDE
 
If you prefer to use AVRDUDE command-line tool to program your AVR microcontrollers, you can also use AVRISP mkII with it. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder where your hex file is located.
2. Type the following command to upload the hex file to your board using AVRISP mkII:

        avrdude -c avrisp2 -P usb -p m328p -U flash:w:your_hex_file.hex

3. Replace m328p with the name of your microcontroller and your\_hex\_file.hex with the name of your hex file.
4. Press Enter and wait for the upload process to finish.

You can also use AVRDUDE to read or write fuses or lock bits using AVRISP mkII. To do that, you need to add the appropriate options to the avrdude command. For example, to read the fuses of your board, you can type:

    avrdude -c avrisp2 -P usb -p m328p -U lfuse:r:-:h -U hfuse:r:-:h -U efuse:r:-:h

This will read the low fuse, high fuse and extended fuse of your board and display them in hexadecimal format. For more information on how to use AVRDUDE, you can check its manual page or website.
