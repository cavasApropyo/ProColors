# What's new in vArranger 2, the ultimate music arranger software?
 
vArranger 2 is a powerful and versatile software that allows you to play and arrange music styles from different hardware arrangers (Yamaha, Korg, Ketron, Roland, Technics) on your computer. You can also use it as a VST host and a software synthesizer that can load external samples in SF2 and SFZ formats.
 
In this article, we will review some of the new features and improvements that have been added to vArranger 2 in the latest version 1.19[^2^].

- **New SFZ format support:** The vArranger software synthesizer can now load SFZ instrument files, which offer more in-depth synthesis options than the SF2 format. You can find many interesting SFZ instruments available for free online.
- **Audio input:** You can now listen to and record the sound from the audio input of your audio card in real-time, without needing a hardware mixer. This is useful to mix an external stereo synth or player or a mono microphone or a guitar with the vArranger audio engine. You can also add some FX to the audio input, such as reverb, chorus and delay, or use your preferred channel strip VST plugin.
- **VST instruments to VST plugins:** You can now send the 16 VST instruments to the 3 vArranger FX engines, by adjusting the level knobs in the VST options screen. This is useful for VSTi that do not include an FX section, or if you want to use the same reverb/chorus/delay for the vArranger software synth and for the VST instruments (and for the audio input). This can also save some CPU resources.
- **Delay to reverb:** You can now send an amount of the FX3 (usually a delay) to the FX1 (usually a reverb). This is especially useful to add some reverb to the echoed voices produced by a delay.
- **SF2/SFZ volumes:** You can now set a different volume for each SF2 or SFZ file. You can change it to adjust the relative volumes between files from different sources.
- **VST intelligent CPU saver:** vArranger now bypasses the VST instruments that are not currently in use in the current patch. This may result in a huge reduction of CPU usage if you load many VSTi, and remove the noises generated by some VST (like the Leslie of VB3) while not currently in use.
- **Better VST loading / unloading:** This can correct some VST plugins that had problems when loading or unloading them.

Now that you know some of the new features and improvements of vArranger 2, you may wonder how to use it effectively and creatively. Fortunately, there are some tutorials available online that can help you get started and master this amazing software.
 
One of them is a YouTube video by MrViolinist57[^1^], who shows how to work with the vArranger sequencer to create an arrangement. He explains how to use the style editor, the chord track, the mixer, the effects, and the automation. He also demonstrates how to export the arrangement as a MIDI file or an audio file.
 
Another tutorial is a YouTube video by Estudios VALOA COMPANY[^2^], who shows how to use vArranger 2 with FL Studio (part 2). He explains how to connect vArranger 2 with FL Studio via loopMIDI and loopBe1, how to assign different VST instruments to different channels, how to sync the tempo and the transport, and how to record the MIDI data from vArranger 2 into FL Studio.
 
If you prefer a written tutorial, you can check out the online manual of vArranger[^3^], which is constructed in form of a Wiki. You can find information about the installation, the configuration, the interface, the functions, and the tips and tricks of vArranger. You can also contribute to the manual by editing it or adding your own experience.
