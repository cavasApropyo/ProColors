The novel is divided into four parts, each with a musical title: Prelude, Magnificat, Repons, and Dies Irae. Each part consists of several chapters that focus on a different couple or individual, revealing their secrets, fantasies, passions, and conflicts. The characters include a politician addicted to sex, a gay couple with different expectations, a woman who discovers her husband's homosexuality and falls in love with another woman, a lonely widower who finds solace in a prostitute, a young girl who seduces her teacher, and many others. Their stories are intertwined by an anonymous letter that they all receive one day, sent by a mysterious dove.
 
Schmitt's novel is a rich and colorful mosaic of human emotions and desires, as well as a portrait of contemporary society and its contradictions. It is also a tribute to the city of Brussels, its history, culture, and diversity. Schmitt draws inspiration from his own experience as a resident of the square where the novel is set, as well as from his observations of the parrots and other birds that have colonized the trees there. He uses them as a metaphor for the freedom and diversity of human sexuality, as well as for the fragility and beauty of life.

Schmitt's literary career began in 1991 with the publication of his first play, *La Nuit de Valognes* (Don Juan on Trial), a witty and irreverent reworking of the Don Juan myth. He followed this with other successful plays, such as *Le Visiteur* (The Visitor), a philosophical dialogue between Freud and God; *Variations Ã©nigmatiques* (Enigmatic Variations), a mystery thriller about a Nobel Prize-winning writer and his biographer; *HÃ´tel des deux mondes* (Between Worlds), a metaphysical drama about a hotel where people who are in a coma are temporarily lodged; and *Petits crimes conjugaux* (Partners in Crime), a psychological thriller about a married couple.
 
Schmitt also wrote several novels and short stories, often inspired by his travels and his interest in different cultures and religions. Some of his most popular works include *Oscar et la dame rose* (Oscar and the Lady in Pink), a touching story of a terminally ill boy who writes letters to God; *Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran* (M. Ibrahim and the Flowers of the Koran), a tale of friendship between a Jewish boy and a Muslim shopkeeper in Paris; *L'Ãvangile selon Pilate* (The Gospel According to Pilate), a historical novel that reimagines the last days of Jesus; *L'Enfant de NoÃ©* (Noah's Child), a novel about a Jewish boy who is hidden by a Catholic priest during World War II; and *La Part de l'autre* (The Alternative Hypothesis), a novel that explores what would have happened if Hitler had been accepted at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts.
 
Schmitt has also directed several films based on his own works, such as *Oscar et la dame rose*, *Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran*, and *Odette Toulemonde*, a comedy about an ordinary woman who is obsessed with her favorite writer. He has received numerous awards and honors for his literary achievements, such as the Grand Prix du ThÃ©Ã¢tre de l'AcadÃ©mie FranÃ§aise, the Prix Goncourt de la Nouvelle, the Prix du ThÃ©Ã¢tre Romain Roland, and the Prix LittÃ©raire EuropÃ©en. He has been translated into more than 40 languages and his plays have been performed in over 50 countries.
 
Schmitt lives in Brussels since 2002 and obtained Belgian citizenship in 2008. He is also an avid pianist and music lover, and has written several musical pieces for his plays. He is currently working on a series of novels called *La TraversÃ©e des temps* (The Crossing of Time), which explores the history of humanity through different eras and civilizations.
