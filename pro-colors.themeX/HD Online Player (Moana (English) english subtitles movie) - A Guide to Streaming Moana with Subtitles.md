Moana is not only a fun and entertaining film, but also a rich and educational one. It is based on the mythology and culture of the Polynesian islands, which are located in the Pacific Ocean. The film explores themes such as identity, courage, family, and environmentalism.
 
One of the most interesting aspects of Moana is its music. The film features songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of Hamilton and In the Heights, as well as Opetaia Foa'i, the leader of Te Vaka, a group that performs contemporary Pacific music. The songs are sung in English, Samoan, Tokelauan, and Tuvaluan languages. The film also features original score composed by Mark Mancina, who has worked on films such as The Lion King and Tarzan.
 
Moana is full of fascinating facts and trivia that you may not have noticed while watching it. For example, did you know that Moana is the 56th animated film by Disney? Or that Lin-Manuel Miranda found out he would be a dad the same week he was contacted to be a part of Moana? Or that Moana was a secondary character in the original idea, while Maui was the main one?[^1^] These are just some of the many things that make Moana a unique and memorable film.
